## Projects Overview

### 1. Socket Programming

This project implements a basic buyer-seller system using TCP sockets. The seller broadcasts advertisements, including its port number, and buyers can connect to make offers. 

### 2. MapReduce

A MapReduce framework is developed to count the number of books in each genre. The framework reads data, performing parallel processing to efficiently categorize and count the books across different genres.

### 3. MultiThreaded Image Processing

This project involves implementing a multi-threaded image processing system that performs operations like horizontal flip, emboss, and diamond effect. The system uses multiple threads to process images concurrently, improving performance and enabling faster processing of large images.
